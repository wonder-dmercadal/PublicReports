## Executive Summary

WDL Engineer is an industrial AI assistant that helps technical professionals make faster, more informed decisions by providing instant access to multi-domain expertise. Rather than waiting hours or days for specialist input, users can photograph or upload technical documents to receive immediate, consensus-based analysis.

## How It Works

### 🔄 The Core Process

<div align="center">

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant W as WDL Engineer
    participant A as AI Agents
    participant K as Knowledge Base
    
    U->>W: Uploads image/document
    W->>A: Distributes to specialized agents
    A->>K: Queries relevant knowledge
    K->>A: Returns context
    A->>A: Agents analyze and debate
    A->>W: Consensus recommendation
    W->>U: Delivers analysis with confidence
    
    Note over U,W: Typical time: 30 seconds to 2 minutes
```

</div>

### 📸 What You Can Analyze

| Input Type | Examples | Typical Analysis Time |
|------------|----------|----------------------|
| **P&IDs** | Process flow diagrams, instrumentation layouts | 30-60 seconds |
| **Specifications** | Vendor sheets, material specs, equipment data | 45-90 seconds |
| **Dashboards** | SCADA screens, control panels, HMI displays | 30-45 seconds |
| **Equipment Photos** | Nameplates (when visible), damage, installations | 60-120 seconds |
| **Technical Documents** | Procedures, manuals, reports | 60-90 seconds |

> ⚠️ **Note**: Equipment identification from field photos requires visible nameplates or tags. Full specification retrieval requires integration with equipment databases.

### 💡 Why Multiple Agents Matter

Traditional single-AI responses provide one perspective. WDL Engineer's multi-agent approach mimics real-world expert consultation:

| Single AI Response | Multi-Agent Consensus |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| "This valve appears suitable" | **Process**: "Flow characteristics match"<br>**Materials**: "Concerned about chloride exposure"<br>**Safety**: "Requires double block and bleed"<br>**Reliability**: "Similar failed after 6 months"<br>**Consensus**: "Not recommended - 78% confidence" |
